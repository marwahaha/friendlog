* Version database
* add shortcut for today / yesterday
* handle error cases from all functions (check parameters)
* be verbose when adding data 
* check if friend exists when adding event (perhaps: prompt first, then create)
* make help
* split into multiple files
* add linter
* add script to add aliasing (or put example aliases in readme)
* handle other date formats (gracefully!)
* script to print history
* config file to store various constants
* if you have no friends, print welcome and/or help message
* make scripts npm-accessible AND fl-accessible
* publish to npm
* tab-complete friends

To spec out:
* mark friends as "scheduled hangout" (to spec)
* facebook integration (to populate names?)
* types of hangouts (granularity? phone call vs 1/1 hangout. to spec out)
* add links to their social media (to schedule a hangout)
* tags on the friend objects (i.e. "frisbee", "music")
* recommend saving data via private git repos or other means (in readme)
* calendar view of history 
* rename a user and migrate all their data to the new username (should we use user ids instead of usernames then?)
* should we use a real database?
* list all hangouts for a friend
* nicknames ("kunal-marwaha" can also be addressed "kunal")
* hangout with multiple people
* "snooze" a person?
