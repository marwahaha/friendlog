To spec out:
* make scripts npm-accessible AND fl-accessible
* mark friends as "scheduled hangout" (to spec)
* facebook integration (to populate names?)
* types of hangouts (granularity? phone call vs 1/1 hangout. to spec out)
* add links to their social media (to schedule a hangout)
* tags on the friend objects (i.e. "frisbee", "music")
* recommend saving data via private git repos or other means (in readme)
* calendar view of history 
* rename a user and migrate all their data to the new username (should we use user ids instead of usernames then?)
* should we use a real database?
* nicknames ("kunal-marwaha" can also be addressed "kunal")
* hangout with multiple people
